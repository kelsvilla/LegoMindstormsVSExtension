Here's a list of things you should do before pushing a PR

1. Do you know if the feature works? Run the extension on a debugger and test what you added. No matter how small the change, test it.
2. Do you have some sort of demo? This can be a before/after photo or a video showcasing your change. This is important so that everyone knows what to expect from your change and how it works. If you want, you can attach your photo/video to a Trello card or PR.
3. Is your code formatted? Run `npm run format` to format all files. You can tell if your file has been changed by checking if the name is white. If it's gray, then it was unchanged.
4. Do you have instructions for testing in your PR? This is important so that other devs know how to test your changes or know what to look out for. Even if its a visual change or there's only one thing to do, write it.
