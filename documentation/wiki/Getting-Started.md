# Speech Recognition

If you are running Mind Reader on MacOS, you may need to install a package called portaudio. This package allows microphone input for PyAudio, a package for audio I/O. You will need to
install homebrew to get portaudio installed. Here are the steps:

1. Close Visual Studio Code
2. Go to [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and follow the steps to install Homebrew
3. On a terminal, run `brew install portaudio`

The Speech Recognition feature should be able to run now. If you are still getting errors, you may need to reinstall the extension.
