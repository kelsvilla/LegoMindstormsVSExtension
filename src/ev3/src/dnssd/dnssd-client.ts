     * For efficiency, clients that perform many concurrent operations may want to use a

     * call DNSServiceCreateConnection(&MainRef) to initialize the main DNSServiceRef.
     * For each subsequent operation that is to share that same connection, the client copies
     * the MainRef, and then passes the address of that copy, setting the ShareConnection flag
     * to tell the library that this DNSServiceRef is not a typical uninitialized DNSServiceRef;
     * it's a copy of an existing DNSServiceRef whose connection information should be reused.
     *
     * For example:
     *
     * DNSServiceErrorType error;
     * DNSServiceRef MainRef;
     * error = DNSServiceCreateConnection(&MainRef);
     * if (error) ...
     * DNSServiceRef BrowseRef = MainRef;  // Important: COPY the primary DNSServiceRef first...
     * error = DNSServiceBrowse(&BrowseRef, ShareConnection, ...); // then use the copy
     * if (error) ...
     * ...
     * DNSServiceRefDeallocate(BrowseRef); // Terminate the browse operation
     * DNSServiceRefDeallocate(MainRef);   // Terminate the shared connection
     * Also see Point 4.(Don't Double-Deallocate if the MainRef has been Deallocated) in Notes below:
     *
     * Notes:
     *
     * 1. Collective MoreComing flag
     * When callbacks are invoked using a shared DNSServiceRef, the
     * MoreComing flag applies collectively to *all* active
     * operations sharing the same parent DNSServiceRef. If the MoreComing flag is
     * set it means that there are more results queued on this parent DNSServiceRef,
     * but not necessarily more results for this particular callback function.
     * The implication of this for client programmers is that when a callback
     * is invoked with the MoreComing flag set, the code should update its
     * internal data structures with the new result, and set a variable indicating
     * that its UI needs to be updated. Then, later when a callback is eventually
     * invoked with the MoreComing flag not set, the code should update *all*
     * stale UI elements related to that shared parent DNSServiceRef that need
     * updating, not just the UI elements related to the particular callback
     * that happened to be the last one to be invoked.
     *
     * 2. Canceling operations and MoreComing
     * Whenever you cancel any operation for which you had deferred UI updates
     * waiting because of a MoreComing flag, you should perform
     * those deferred UI updates. This is because, after cancelling the operation,
     * you can no longer wait for a callback *without* MoreComing set, to tell
     * you do perform your deferred UI updates (the operation has been canceled,
     * so there will be no more callbacks). An implication of the collective
     * MoreComing flag for shared connections is that this
     * guideline applies more broadly -- any time you cancel an operation on
     * a shared connection, you should perform all deferred UI updates for all
     * operations sharing that connection. This is because the MoreComing flag
     * might have been referring to events coming for the operation you canceled,
     * which will now not be coming because the operation has been canceled.
     *
     * 3. Only share DNSServiceRef's created with DNSServiceCreateConnection
     * Calling DNSServiceCreateConnection(&ref) creates a special shareable DNSServiceRef.
     * DNSServiceRef's created by other calls like DNSServiceBrowse() or DNSServiceResolve()
     * cannot be shared by copying them and using ShareConnection.
     *
     * 4. Don't Double-Deallocate if the MainRef has been Deallocated
     * Calling DNSServiceRefDeallocate(ref) for a particular operation's DNSServiceRef terminates
     * just that operation. Calling DNSServiceRefDeallocate(ref) for the main shared DNSServiceRef
     * (the parent DNSServiceRef, originally created by DNSServiceCreateConnection(&ref))
     * automatically terminates the shared connection and all operations that were still using it.
     * After doing this, DO NOT then attempt to deallocate any remaining subordinate DNSServiceRef's.
     * The memory used by those subordinate DNSServiceRef's has already been freed, so any attempt
     * to do a DNSServiceRefDeallocate (or any other operation) on them will result in accesses
     * to freed memory, leading to crashes or other equally undesirable results.
     *
     * 5. Thread Safety
     * The dns_sd.h API does not presuppose any particular threading model, and consequently
     * does no locking internally (which would require linking with a specific threading library).
     * If the client concurrently, from multiple threads (or contexts), calls API routines using
     * the same DNSServiceRef, it is the client's responsibility to provide mutual exclusion for
     * that DNSServiceRef.

     * For example, use of DNSServiceRefDeallocate requires caution. A common mistake is as follows:
     * Thread B calls DNSServiceRefDeallocate to deallocate sdRef while Thread A is processing events
     * using sdRef. Doing this will lead to intermittent crashes on thread A if the sdRef is used after
     * it was deallocated.

     * A telltale sign of this crash type is to see DNSServiceProcessResult on the stack preceding the
     * actual crash location.

     * To state this more explicitly, mDNSResponder does not queue DNSServiceRefDeallocate so
     * that it occurs discretely before or after an event is handled.

	/**
	 * @param flags     Pass ServiceFlags.LongLivedQuery to create a "long-lived" unicast
	 *                  query in a non-local domain.  Without setting this flag, unicast queries
	 *                  will be one-shot - that is, only answers available at the time of the call
	 *                  will be returned.  By setting this flag, answers (including Add and Remove
	 *                  events) that become available after the initial call is made will generate
	 *                  callbacks.  This flag has no effect on link-local multicast queries.
	 * @param iface     If non-zero, specifies the interface on which to issue the query
	 *                  (the index for a given interface is determined via the if_nametoindex()
	 *                  family of calls.)  Passing 0 causes the name to be queried for on all
	 *                  interfaces. See "Constants for specifying an interface index" for more details.
	 * @param fullName  The full domain name of the resource record to be queried for.
	 * @param rrType    The numerical type of the resource record to be queried for
	 *                  (e.g. ServiceType.PTR, ServiceType.SRV, etc)
	 * @param rrClass   The class of the resource record (usually ServiceClass.IN).
	 * @param callback  The function to be called when a result is found, or if the call
	 *                  asynchronously fails.
